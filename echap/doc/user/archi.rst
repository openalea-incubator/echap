Objects manipulated
===================

MTG representing the plant with dimensions, tissue state, parameters (rate senescenceâ€¦)


ADEL
====

Plant/canopy model initialisation as an MTG = f(architectural field data)
Plant/canopy growth (updated MTG) = f(current MTG,  Temperature, dt)
Plant/canopy senescence (updated MTG + current progress = f(current MTG, Temperature, dt)
3D canopy (PlantGL scene graph)= f(current MTG)
