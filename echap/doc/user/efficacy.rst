WP 2: Effect of pesticide on Infectious Cycle
#############################################


Description
===========

This module allows: 

- to compute globaly decay of dose on leaves as a function of time
- to compute the global efficacy on infection and lesion development rate  of a set of compound doses fungii
- to compute an erosion factor of compounds as a function of doses sprayed per year

It is based on the paper : A model of the effect of fungicides on disease-induced yield loss, for use in wheat disease management decision support system. Annals of Applied Biology. 151, p.113-125 by Milne et al., 2007
